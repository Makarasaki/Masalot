# Masalot - A Chess Engine
**Master's Thesis Repository**

Masalot is a chess engine with a playing strength estimated at around **1515 Elo**. This repository includes:

- **Neural Network Training and Testing**: Code to train and evaluate networks for chess position analysis.
- **Chess Engine Implementation**: A fully functional engine using alpha-beta pruning with the MVV-LVA heuristic.
- **Move Generation**: Integrations with [Gigantua](https://github.com/Gigantua/Gigantua) and [MidnightMoveGen](https://github.com/archishou/MidnightMoveGen) for fast and efficient move generation.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or contribute to this project!
